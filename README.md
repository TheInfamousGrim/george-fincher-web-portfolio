# George Fincher Web Portfolio

## Description

A portfolio of all the work and projects I've completed. Email [finchergeorge1@gmail.com](mailto:finchergeorge1@gmail.com) if you're interested in hiring or looking to work with me.

The portfolio itself shows the skills I've accrued using all the various technologies I've learned over the short time I've been coding diligently.

### User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### What did I Learn

- I'm fairly familiar with most of these technologies but I've learned more about using media queries effectively.
- I've also learned more about how to use grid.
- I've learned how to use inline SVGs and how to style them effectively.
- I've learned more about using figma to help wire-frame and design the sites I make.
